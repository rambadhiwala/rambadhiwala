## 🛡️ About Me

I’m a **SOC Analyst with 4+ years of experience** supporting enterprise and financial environments. I specialize in **alert triage, incident investigation, and threat containment** across high-volume SOC operations.

I have hands-on experience with **Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, CrowdStrike, QRadar, and SOAR automation**, with a strong focus on **MITRE ATT&CK–aligned investigations**, audit-ready documentation, and response optimization.

My goal is to build **accurate detections, reduce false positives, and improve response speed** while collaborating closely with network, cloud, and identity teams.
